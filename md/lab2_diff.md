### Lab: Exploring Git Diff Changes

As we saw in the previous lab, we can refer to commits by their
identifiers. You can refer to the *most recent commit* of the working
directory by using the identifier `HEAD`.

We've been adding one line at a time to `mars.txt`, so it's easy to track our progress by looking, so
let's do that using our `HEAD`s.
Before we start, let's make a change to `mars.txt`, adding yet another line.



``` 
$ cd ~/Desktop/planets
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```





``` 
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
An ill-considered change
```



Now, let's see what we get.



``` 
$ git diff HEAD mars.txt
```





``` 
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index b36abfd..0848c8d 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt

```



which is the same as what you would get if you leave out
`HEAD` (try it). The real
goodness in all this is when you can refer to previous commits. We do
that by adding `~1` (where "\~"
is "tilde", pronounced \[**til**-d*uh*\]) to refer to the commit one
before `HEAD`.



``` 
$ git diff HEAD~1 mars.txt
```



If we want to see the differences between older commits we can use
`git diff` again, but with the
notation `HEAD~1`,
`HEAD~2`, and so on, to refer to
them:



``` 
$ git diff HEAD~3 mars.txt
```





``` 
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..b36abfd 100644

We could also use `git show`
which shows us what changes we made at an older commit as well as the
commit message, rather than the *differences* between a commit and our
working directory that we see by using `git diff`.



``` 
$ git show HEAD~3 mars.txt
```

In this way, we can build up a chain of commits. The most recent end of
the chain is referred to as `HEAD`; we can refer to previous commits using the
`~` notation, so
`HEAD~1` means "the previous
commit", while `HEAD~123` goes
back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using those long strings of digits and
letters that `git log` displays.
These are unique IDs for the changes, and "unique" really does mean
unique: every change to any set of files on any computer has a unique
40-character identifier. Our first commit was given the ID, so let's try this:



``` 
$ git diff UPDATE_ID_HERE mars.txt
```





``` 
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..93a3e13 100644

That's the right answer, but typing out random 40-character strings is
annoying, so Git lets us use just the first few characters (typically
seven for normal size projects):



``` 
$ git diff UPDATE_ID_HERE mars.txt
```





``` 
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..93a3e13 100644

All right! So we can save changes to files and see what we've changed.
Now, how can we restore older versions of things? Let's suppose we
change our mind about the last update to `mars.txt` (the "ill-considered change").

`git status` now tells us that
the file has been changed, but those changes haven't been staged:



``` 
$ git status
```





``` 
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```



We can put things back the way they were by using
`git checkout`:



``` 
$ git checkout HEAD mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```





``` 
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
```



As you might guess from its name, `git checkout` checks out (i.e., restores) an old version of a
file. In this case, we're telling Git that we want to recover the
version of the file recorded in `HEAD`, which is the last saved commit. If we want to go
back even further, we can use a commit identifier instead:



``` 
$ git checkout UPDATE_ID_HERE mars.txt
```



``` 
$ cat mars.txt
```



``` 
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
```




``` 
$ git status
```




``` 
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

    modified:   mars.txt
```



Notice that the changes are currently in the staging area. Again, we can
put things back the way they were by using
`git checkout`:



``` 
$ git checkout HEAD mars.txt
```
