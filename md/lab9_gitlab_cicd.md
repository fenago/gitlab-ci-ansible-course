## Lab: Create and run your first GitLab CI/CD pipeline

This lab shows you how to configure and run your first CI/CD
pipeline in GitLab.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

-   A project in GitLab that you would like to use CI/CD for.
-   The Maintainer or Owner role for the project.

If you don't have a project, you can create a public project for free on
[https://gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/).

## Steps

To create and run your first pipeline:

1.  Ensure you have runners available to run your jobs.

    If you're using GitLab.com, you can skip this step. GitLab.com
    provides shared runners for you.

2.  Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file at the root of your repository. This file is where you define the CI/CD jobs.

When you commit the file to your repository, the runner runs your jobs.
The job results are displayed in a pipeline.

## Ensure you have runners available

In GitLab, runners are agents that run your CI/CD jobs.

To view available runners:

-   Go to **Settings \> CI/CD** and expand **Runners**.

As long as you have at least one runner that's active, with a green
circle next to it, you have a runner available to process your jobs.

When your CI/CD jobs run, in a later step, they will run on your local
machine.

## Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file 

Now create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. It is a **YAML** file where you specify
instructions for GitLab CI/CD.

In this file, you define:

-   The structure and order of jobs that the runner should execute.
-   The decisions the runner should make when specific conditions are
    encountered.

To create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

1.  On the left sidebar, select **Repository \> Files**.

2.  Above the file list, select the branch you want to commit to. If
    you're not sure, leave `master` or
    `main`. Then select the plus icon and **New file**:

    [![New
    file](./images/new_file_v13_6.png)](./images/new_file_v13_6.png)

3.  For the **Filename**, type `.gitlab-ci.yml` and
    in the larger window, paste this sample code:

    
    
    ```
    build-job:
      stage: build
      script:
        - echo "Hello, $GITLAB_USER_LOGIN!"

    test-job1:
      stage: test
      script:
        - echo "This job tests something"

    test-job2:
      stage: test
      script:
        - echo "This job tests something, but takes more time than test-job1."
        - echo "After the echo commands complete, it runs the sleep command for 20 seconds"
        - echo "which simulates a test that runs 20 seconds longer than test-job1"
        - sleep 20

    deploy-prod:
      stage: deploy
      script:
        - echo "This job deploys something from the $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH branch."
      environment: production
    ```
    
    

    This example shows four jobs: `build-job`,
    `test-job1`, `test-job2`,
    and `deploy-prod`. The comments listed in the
    `echo` commands are displayed in the UI when you
    view the jobs. The values for the [predefined
    variables]
    `$GITLAB_USER_LOGIN` and
    `$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH` are populated when the jobs
    run.

4.  Select **Commit changes**.

The pipeline starts and runs the jobs you defined in the
`.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

## View the status of your pipeline and jobs

Now take a look at your pipeline and the jobs within.

1.  Go to **CI/CD \> Pipelines**. A pipeline with three stages should be
    displayed:

    [![Three
    stages](./images/three_stages_v13_6.png)](./images/three_stages_v13_6.png)

2.  View a visual representation of your pipeline by selecting the
    pipeline ID:

    [![Pipeline
    graph](./images/pipeline_graph_v13_6.png)](./images/pipeline_graph_v13_6.png)

3.  View details of a job by selecting the job name. For example,
    `deploy-prod`:

    [![Job

You have successfully created your first CI/CD pipeline in GitLab.
Congratulations!


### Disabling GitLab CI/CD

GitLab CI/CD is enabled by default on all new projects. If you use an
external CI/CD server like Jenkins or Drone CI, you can disable GitLab
CI/CD to avoid conflicts with the commits status API.


## Disable CI/CD in a project

When you disable GitLab CI/CD:

-   The **CI/CD** item in the left sidebar is removed.
-   The `/pipelines` and `/jobs`
    pages are no longer available.
-   Existing jobs and pipelines are hidden, not removed.

To disable GitLab CI/CD in your project:

1.  On the top bar, select **Main menu \> Projects** and find your
    project.
2.  On the left sidebar, select **Settings \> General**.
3.  Expand **Visibility, project features, permissions**.
4.  In the **Repository** section, turn off **CI/CD**.
5.  Select **Save changes**.

## Enable CI/CD in a project

To enable GitLab CI/CD in your project:

1.  On the top bar, select **Main menu \> Projects** and find your
    project.
2.  On the left sidebar, select **Settings \> General**.
3.  Expand **Visibility, project features, permissions**.
4.  In the **Repository** section, turn on **CI/CD**.
5.  Select **Save changes**.
