# Managing Merge Requests

There are many different ways to create a merge request.


### Task: Make changes in Gitlab Repo

1. Switch to `example-tutorial-branch` in terminal of repo created in lab 3.
2.  Make changes in `README.md` and push the changes.

Merge requests are designed around a one-to-one (1:1) branch
relationship. Only one open merge request may be associated with a given
target branch at a time.

6. You can merge the **merge request** as shown below:

### Revert a merge request

You can revert an entire merge request in GitLab.
When you revert a commit in Git, you create a new commit that reverses
all actions taken in the original commit:


After a merge request is merged, you can revert all changes in the merge
request.

**Prerequisites:**

-   You must have a role in the project that allows you to edit merge
    requests, and add code to the repository.
-   Your project must use the [merge method]
    **Merge Commit**, which is set in the project's **Settings \>
    General \> Merge request**. You can't revert fast-forwarded commits
    from the GitLab UI.

To do this:

1.  On the top bar, select **Main menu \> Projects** and find your
    project.
2.  On the left sidebar, select **Merge requests** and identify your
    merge request.
3.  Scroll to the merge request reports area, and find the report
    showing when the merge request was merged.
4.  Select **Revert**.

5.  In **Revert in branch**, select the branch to revert your changes
    into.
6.  Optional. Select **Start a new merge request** to start a new merge
    request with the new revert commit.
7.  Select **Revert**.

The option to **Revert** is no longer shown after a merge request is
reverted.

3.  Select the **Target branch** or create a new branch by typing the
    name (without spaces, capital letters, or special chars).
4.  Select the **Start a new merge request with these changes** checkbox
    or toggle. This checkbox or toggle is visible only if the target is
    not the same as the source branch, or if the source branch is
    protected.
5.  Select **Commit changes**.

## Task Create Merge Request: When you create a branch

    request**. A merge request is created. The default branch is the
