Lab 16. Playbooks and Roles
===========================


In this lab, we will cover the following topics:

-   Understanding the playbook framework
-   Understanding roles---the playbook organizer
-   Using conditions in your code
-   Repeating tasks with loops
-   Grouping tasks using blocks
-   Configuring play execution via strategies
-   Using [ansible-pull]


#### Lab Environment

All lab file are present at below path. Run following command in the terminal first before running commands in the lab:

`cd ~/Desktop/gitlab-ci-ansible-course/Lab_16` 


Understanding the playbook framework
====================================


Although YAML format is easy to read and write, it is very pedantic when
it comes to spacing. For example, you cannot use tabs to set indentation
even though on the screen a tab and four spaces might look
identical---in YAML, they are not. We recommend that you adopt an editor
with YAML support to aid you in writing your playbooks if you are doing
this for the first time, perhaps Vim, Visual Studio Code, or Eclipse, as
these will help you to ensure that your indentation is correct. To test
the playbooks we develop in this lab, we will reuse a variant of an
inventory created in Lab 3 (unless stated otherwise):


```
[frontends]
frt01.example.com https_port=8443
frt02.example.com http_proxy=proxy.example.com

[frontends:vars]
ntp_server=ntp.frt.example.com
proxy=proxy.frt.example.com

[apps]
app01.example.com
app02.example.com

[webapp:children]
frontends
apps

[webapp:vars]
proxy_server=proxy.webapp.example.com
health_check_retry=3
health_check_interal=60
```




Let\'s dive right in and get started writing a playbook. 

1.  Create a simple playbook to run on the hosts in
    the [frontends] host group defined in our inventory file. We
    can set the user that will access the hosts using the
    [remote\_user] directive in the playbook as demonstrated in
    the following (you can also use the [\--user] switch on the
    command line, but as this lab is about playbook development,
    we\'ll ignore that for now):

```
---
- hosts: frontends
  remote_user: root

  tasks:
  - name: simple connection test
    ping:
    remote_user: root
```

2.  Add another task below the first to run the [shell] module
    (that will, in turn, run the [ls] command on the remote
    hosts). We\'ll also add the [ignore\_errors] directive to this
    task to ensure that our playbook doesn\'t fail if the [ls]
    command fails (for example, if the directory we\'re trying to list
    doesn\'t exist). Be careful with the indentation and ensure it
    matches that of the first part of the file:

```
  - name: run a simple command
    shell: /bin/ls -al /nonexistent
    ignore_errors: True
```

Let\'s see how our newly created playbook behaves when we run it:


```
ansible-playbook -i hosts myplaybook.yaml

PLAY [frontends] ***************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [frt02.example.com]
ok: [frt01.example.com]

TASK [simple connection test] **************************************************
ok: [frt01.example.com]
ok: [frt02.example.com]

TASK [run a simple command] ****************************************************
fatal: [frt02.example.com]: FAILED! => {"changed": true, "cmd": "/bin/ls -al /nonexistent", "delta": "0:00:00.015687", "end": "2020-04-10 16:37:56.895520", "msg": "non-zero return code", "rc": 2, "start": "2020-04-10 16:37:56.879833", "stderr": "/bin/ls: cannot access /nonexistent: No such file or directory", "stderr_lines": ["/bin/ls: cannot access /nonexistent: No such file or directory"], "stdout": "", "stdout_lines": []}
...ignoring
fatal: [frt01.example.com]: FAILED! => {"changed": true, "cmd": "/bin/ls -al /nonexistent", "delta": "0:00:00.012160", "end": "2020-04-10 16:37:56.930058", "msg": "non-zero return code", "rc": 2, "start": "2020-04-10 16:37:56.917898", "stderr": "/bin/ls: cannot access /nonexistent: No such file or directory", "stderr_lines": ["/bin/ls: cannot access /nonexistent: No such file or directory"], "stdout": "", "stdout_lines": []}
...ignoring

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
frt01.example.com : ok=3 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=1
frt02.example.com : ok=3 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=1
```

From the output of the playbook run, you can see that our two tasks were
executed in the order in which they were specified. We can see that the
[ls] command failed because we tried to list a directory that did
not exist, but the playbook did not register any [failed] tasks
because we set [ignore\_errors] to [true] for this task (and
only this task).


A handler is a special type of task that is run as a result of a
[notify]. However, unlike Ansible playbook tasks, which are
performed in sequence, handlers are all grouped together and run at the
very end of the play. Also, they can be notified more than once but will
only be run once regardless, again preventing needless service restarts.
Consider the following playbook:


#### Change Apache Port

Let's change the default Apache port using template as port 80 is already in use by lab environment.


```
---
- name: Handler demo 1
  hosts: frt01.example.com
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Update Apache configuration
      template:
        src: template.j2
        dest: /etc/apache2/ports.conf
      notify: Restart Apache

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted
```


**Note:** Make sure that apache2 is intalled before running the playbook: `service apache2 status`

You can install apache2 by running `apt-get install -y apache2`. It can also installed by running following playbook:

```
cd ~/Desktop/gitlab-ci-ansible-course/Lab_14
ansible-playbook update-apache-version.yml
```


If we run this task a first time, we will see the following results:

```
cd ~/Desktop/gitlab-ci-ansible-course/Lab_16
ansible-playbook -i hosts handlers1.yml

PLAY [Handler demo 1] **********************************************************

TASK [Update Apache configuration] *********************************************
changed: [frt01.example.com]

RUNNING HANDLER [Restart Apache] ***********************************************
changed: [frt01.example.com]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
frt01.example.com : ok=2 changed=2 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
```


Notice how the handler was run at the end, as the configuration file was
updated. However, if we run this playbook a second time without making
any changes to the template or configuration file, we will see something
like this:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts handlers1.yml

PLAY [Handler demo 1] **********************************************************

TASK [Update Apache configuration] *********************************************
ok: [frt01.example.com]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
frt01.example.com : ok=1 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
```

This time, the handler was not called as the result from the
configuration task as OK. All handlers should have a globally unique
name so that the notify action can call the correct handler. You could
also call multiple handlers by setting a common name for using the
[listen] directive---this way, you can call either the handler
[name] or the [listen] string---as demonstrated in the
following example:

```
---
- name: Handler demo 1
  hosts: frt01.example.com
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  handlers:
    - name: restart ntp
      service:
        name: ntp
        state: restarted
      listen: "restart all services"
    - name: restart apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted
      listen: "restart all services"

  tasks:
    - name: restart all services
      command: echo "this task will restart all services"
      notify: "restart all services"
```



We only have one task in the playbook, but when we run it, both handlers
are called. Also, remember that we said earlier that [command] was
among a set of modules that were a special case because they can\'t
detect whether a change has occurred---as a result, they always return
the [changed] value, and so, in this demo playbook, the handlers
will always be notified:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts handlers2.yml

PLAY [Handler demo 1] **********************************************************

TASK [restart all services] ****************************************************
changed: [frt01.example.com]

RUNNING HANDLER [restart ntp] **********************************************
changed: [frt01.example.com]

RUNNING HANDLER [restart apache] ***********************************************
changed: [frt01.example.com]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
frt01.example.com : ok=3 changed=3 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
```

These are some of the fundamentals that you need to know to start
writing your own playbooks. With these under your belt, let\'s run
through a comparison of ad hoc commands and playbooks in the next
section.



Comparing playbooks and ad hoc tasks
------------------------------------

Let\'s develop a practical example---suppose you want to install Apache. There are a number of steps involved even if the default
configuration is sufficient (which is unlikely, but for now, we\'ll keep
the example simple). If you were to perform the basic installation by
hand, you would need to install the package, open up the firewall, and
ensure the service is running (and runs at boot time).

To perform these commands in the shell, you might do the following:

```
sudo apt install apache2
sudo service apache2 start
sudo service apache2 status
```

**Note:** Start will fail because port 80 is already in use by lab environment. make sure tha  `/etc/apache2/ports.conf` is updated; port `80` with port `81`.


Now, for each of these commands, there is an equivalent ad hoc Ansible
command that you could run. We won\'t go through all of them here in the
interests of space; however, let\'s say you want to restart the Apache
service---in this case, you could run an ad hoc command similar to the
following (again, we will perform it only on one host for conciseness):

```
ansible -i hosts frt01* -m service -a "name=apache2 state=restarted"
```

When run successfully, you will see pages of shell output containing all
of the variable data returned from running the service module in this
way. A snippet of this is shown in the following for you to check yours
against---the key thing being that the command resulted in the
[changed] status, meaning that it ran successfully and that the
service was indeed restarted:


```
frt01.example.com | CHANGED => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
    },
    "changed": true,
    "name": "apache2",
    "state": "started",
```



A playbook is a far more valuable way to approach this---not only
will it perform all of the steps in one go, but it will also give you a
record of how it was done for you to refer to later on. There are
multiple ways to do this, but consider the following as an example:

```
---
- name: Install Apache
  hosts: frt01.example.com
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache package
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: latest
    - name: Restart and enable the service
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted
        enabled: yes
```

Now, when you run this, you should see that all of our installation
requirements have been completed by one fairly simple and easy to read
playbook. There is a new concept here, loops, which we haven\'t covered
yet, but don\'t worry, we will cover this later in this lab:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts installapache.yml

PLAY [Install Apache] **********************************************************

TASK [Install Apache package] **************************************************
changed: [frt01.example.com]

TASK [Restart and enable the service] ******************************************
changed: [frt01.example.com]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
frt01.example.com : ok=2 changed=3 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
```

As you can see, this is far better for capturing what was actually done
and documenting it in a format that someone else could easily pick up.
Even though we will cover loops later on in the course, it\'s fairly easy
to see from the preceding how they might be working. With this set out,
let\'s proceed in the next section to look in more detail at a couple of
terms we have used several times to ensure you are clear on their
meanings: **plays** and **tasks**.



Defining plays and tasks
------------------------

Suppose we want to write a single playbook to configure both the frontend
servers and the application servers. We could use two separate playbooks
to configure the front end and application servers, but this risks
fragmenting your code and making it difficult to organize. However,
front end servers and application servers are going to be (by their very
nature) fundamentally different and so are unlikely to be configured
with the same set of tasks.

The solution to this problem is to create a single playbook with two
plays in it. The start of each play can be identified by the line at the
lowest indentation (that is, zero spaces in front of it). Let\'s get
started with building up our playbook:

1.  Add the first play to the playbook and define some simple tasks to
    set up the Apache server on the front end, as shown here:

```
---
- name: Play 1 - configure the frontend servers
  hosts: frontends
  become: yes

  tasks:
  - name: Install the Apache package
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: latest
  - name: Start the Apache server
    service:
      name: apache2
      state: started
```

2.  Immediately below this, in the same file, add the second play to
    configure the application tier servers:

```
- name: Play 2 - configure the application servers
  hosts: apps
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: Install NTP
    apt:
      name: ntp
      state: latest
  - name: Start the NTP server
    service:
      name: ntp
      state: started
```

Now, you have two plays: one to install web servers in the
[frontends] group and one to install application servers in the
[apps] group, all combined into one simple playbook.

When we run this playbook, we\'ll see the two plays performed
sequentially, in the order they appear in the playbook. Note the
presence of the [PLAY] keyword, which denotes the start of each
play:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts playandtask.yml

PLAY [Play 1 - configure the frontend servers] *********************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
changed: [frt02.example.com]
changed: [frt01.example.com]

TASK [Install the Apache package] *********************************************
changed: [frt01.example.com]
changed: [frt02.example.com]

TASK [Start the Apache server] *************************************************
changed: [frt01.example.com]
changed: [frt02.example.com]

PLAY [Play 2 - configure the application servers] *******************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
changed: [app01.example.com]
changed: [app02.example.com]

TASK [Install NTP] **********************************************************
changed: [app02.example.com]
changed: [app01.example.com]

TASK [Start the NTP server] *************************************************
changed: [app02.example.com]
changed: [app01.example.com]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
app01.example.com : ok=3 changed=2 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
app02.example.com : ok=3 changed=2 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
frt01.example.com : ok=3 changed=2 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
frt02.example.com : ok=3 changed=2 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
```

There we have it---one playbook, yet two distinct plays operating on
different sets of hosts from the provided inventories. This is very
powerful, especially when combined with roles (which will be covered
later in this course). Of course, you can have just one play in your
playbook---you don\'t have to have multiple ones, but it is important to
be able to develop multi-play playbooks as you will almost certainly
find them useful as your environment gets more complex.



Understanding roles -- the playbook organizer
=============================================


The process of creating roles is in fact very simple---Ansible will (by
default) look within the same directory as you are running your playbook
from for a [roles/] directory, and in here, you will create one
subdirectory for each role. The role name is derived from the
subdirectory name---there is no need to create complex metadata or
anything else---it really is that simple. Within each subdirectory goes
a fixed directory structure that tells Ansible what the tasks, default
variables, handlers, and so on are for each role.


The [roles/] directory is not the only play Ansible will look for
roles---this is the first directory it will look in, but it will then
look in [/etc/ansible/roles] for any additional roles. This can be
further customized through the Ansible configuration file.


Let\'s explore this in a little more detail. Consider the following
directory structure:

```
site.yml
frontends.yml
dbservers.yml
roles/
   installapache/
     tasks/
     handlers/
     templates/
     vars/
     defaults/
   installntp/
     tasks/
     meta/
```


For the examples we will develop in this part of this lab, we will
need an inventory, so let\'s reuse the inventory we used in the previous
section (included in the following for convenience):

```
[frontends]
frt01.example.com https_port=8443
frt02.example.com http_proxy=proxy.example.com

[frontends:vars]
ntp_server=ntp.frt.example.com
proxy=proxy.frt.example.com

[apps]
app01.example.com
app02.example.com

[webapp:children]
frontends
apps

[webapp:vars]
proxy_server=proxy.webapp.example.com
health_check_retry=3
health_check_interal=60
```

Let\'s get started with some practical exercises to help you to learn
how to create and work with roles. We\'ll start by creating a role
called [installapache], which will handle the Apache installation
process we looked at in the previous section. However, here, we will
expand it to cover the installation of Apache on both CentOS and Ubuntu.
This is good practice, especially if you are looking to submit your
roles back to the community as the more general purpose they are (and
the wider the range of systems they will work on), the more useful they
will be to people. Step through the following process to create your
first role:\

1.  Create the directory structure for the [installapache] role
    from within your chosen playbook directory---this is as simple as
    this:

```
mkdir -p roles/installapache/tasks
```

2.  Now, let\'s create the mandatory [main.yml] inside the
    [tasks] directory we just created. This won\'t actually
    perform the Apache installation---rather, it will call one of two
    external tasks files, depending on the operating system detected on
    the target host during the fact-gathering stage. We can use this
    special variable,  [ansible\_distribution], in a [when]
    condition to determine which of the tasks files to import:

```
---
- name: import a tasks based on OS platform 
  import_tasks: centos.yml 
  when: ansible_distribution == 'CentOS' 
- import_tasks: ubuntu.yml 
  when: ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'
```

2.  Create [centos.yml] in [roles/installapache/tasks] to
    install the latest version of the Apache web server via the
    [apt] package manager. This should contain the following
    content:

```
---
- name: Install Apache using apt
  apt:
    name: "apache2"
    state: latest
- name: Start the Apache server
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: started
```

3.  Create a file called [ubuntu.yml] in
    [roles/installapache/tasks] to install the latest version of
    the Apache web server via the [apt] package manager on Ubuntu.
    Notice how the content differs between CentOS and Ubuntu hosts:

```
---
- name: Install Apache using apt
  apt:
    name: "apache2"
    state: latest
- name: Start the Apache server
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: started
```


Now, roles don\'t run by themselves---we have to create a playbook to
call them, so let\'s write a simple playbook to call our newly created
role. This has a play definition just like we saw before, but then
rather than having a [tasks:] section within the play, we have a
[roles:] section where the roles are declared instead. Convention
dictates that this file be called [site.yml], but you are free to
call it whatever you like:

```
---
- name: Install Apache using a role
  hosts: frontends
  become: true

  roles:
    - installapache
```

For clarity, your final directory structure should look like this:

```
.
├── roles
│   └── installapache
│   └── tasks
│   ├── centos.yml
│   ├── main.yml
│   └── ubuntu.yml
└── site.yml
```

With this completed, you can now run your [site.yml] playbook
using [ansible-playbook] in the normal way---you should see output
similar to this:

```
cd ~/Desktop/gitlab-ci-ansible-course/Lab_16/role-example1
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml

PLAY [Install Apache using a role] *********************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [frt01.example.com]
ok: [frt02.example.com]

TASK [installapache : Install Apache using apt] ********************************
changed: [frt02.example.com]
changed: [frt01.example.com]

TASK [installapache : Start the Apache server] *********************************
changed: [frt01.example.com]
changed: [frt02.example.com]

TASK [installapache : Install Apache using apt] ********************************
skipping: [frt01.example.com]

frt02.example.com : ok=3 changed=2 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=2 rescued=0 ignored=0
```

<span style="color:red;">Since we have added hosts in `/etc/hosts` with `127.0.0.1` address so they are pointing to same machine, we might apt get locking error which can be ignored. This error won't occur using multiple machines</span>


Before we look at some of the other aspects relating to roles, let\'s
take a look at some other ways to call your role. Ansible allows you to
statically import or dynamically include roles when you write a
playbook. The syntax between these importing or including a role is
subtly different, and notably, both go in the tasks section of your
playbook rather than in the roles section. The following is a
hypothetical example that shows both options in a really simple
playbook. The roles directory structure including both the
[common] and [approle] roles would have been created in a
similar manner as in the preceding example:

```
--- 
- name: Play to import and include a role
  hosts: frontends
  
  tasks:
  - import_role:
      name: common
  - include_role:
      name: approle
```



Setting up role-based variables and dependencies
------------------------------------------------


Roles based variables can go in one of two locations:

-   [defaults/main.yml]
-   [vars/main.yml]


**Note:** Complete example is available at:

`cd ~/Desktop/gitlab-ci-ansible-course/Lab_16/role-example2` 


We shall see examples of both of these as we build our example:

1.  At the top level of our practical example, we will have a copy of
    the same inventory we have been using throughout this lab. We
    will also create a simple playbook called [site.yml], which
    contains the following code:

```
---
- name: Role variables and meta playbook
  hosts: frt01.example.com

  roles:
    - platform
```

Notice that we are simply calling one role called [platform] from
this playbook---nothing else is called from the playbook itself.

2.  Let\'s go ahead and create the [platform] role---unlike our
    previous role, this will not contain any tasks or even any variable
    data; instead, it will just contain a [meta] directory:

```
mkdir -p roles/platform/meta
```

Inside this directory, create a file called [main.yml] with the
following contents:

```
---
dependencies:
- role: linuxtype
  vars:
    type: centos
- role: linuxtype
  vars:
    type: ubuntu
```

This code will tell Ansible that the platform role is dependent on the
[linuxtype] role. Notice that we are specifying the dependency
twice, but each type we specify it, we are passing it a variable called
[type] with a different value---in this way, the Ansible parser
allows us to call the role twice because a different variable value has
been passed to it each time it is referred to as a dependency.

3.  Let\'s now go ahead and create the [linuxtype] role---again,
    this will contain no tasks, but more dependency declarations:

```
mkdir -p roles/linuxtype/meta/
```

Again, create a [main.yml] file in the [meta] directory, but
this time containing the following:

```
---
dependencies:
- role: version
- role: network
```

Once again, we are creating more dependencies---this time, when the
[linuxtype] role is called, it, in turn, is declaring dependencies
on roles called [version] and [network].

4.  Let\'s create the [version] role first---this will have both
    [meta] and [tasks] directories in it:

```
mkdir -p roles/version/meta
mkdir -p roles/version/tasks
```

In the [meta] directory, we\'ll create a [main.yml] file
with the following contents:

```
---
allow_duplicates: true
```

This declaration is important in this example---as discussed earlier,
normally Ansible will only allow a role to be executed once, even if it
is called multiple times. Setting [allow\_duplicates] to
[true] tells Ansible to allow the execution of the role more than
once. This is required because, in the [platform] role, we call
(via a dependency) the [linuxtype] role twice, which means, in
turn, we will call the [version] role twice.

We\'ll also create a simple [main.yml] file in the tasks
directory, which prints the value of the [type] variable that gets
passed to the role:

```
---
- name: Print type variable
  debug:
    var: type
```

5.  We will now repeat the process with the [network] role---to
    keep our example code simple, we\'ll define it with the same
    contents as the [version] role:

```
mkdir -p roles/network/meta
mkdir -p roles/network/tasks
```

In the [meta] directory, we\'ll again create
a [main.yml] file with the following contents:

```
---
allow_duplicates: true
```

Again, we\'ll create a simple [main.yml] file in the [tasks]
directory, which prints the value of the [type] variable that gets
passed to the role:

```
---
- name: Print type variable
  debug:
    var: type
```

At the end of this process, your directory structure should look like
this:

```
.
├── hosts
├── roles
│   ├── linuxtype
│   │   └── meta
│   │       └── main.yml
│   ├── network
│   │   ├── meta
│   │   │   └── main.yml
│   │   └── tasks
│   │       └── main.yml
│   ├── platform
│   │   └── meta
│   │       └── main.yml
│   └── version
│       ├── meta
│       │   └── main.yml
│       └── tasks
│           └── main.yml
└── site.yml

11 directories, 8 files
```

Let\'s see what happens when we run this playbook. Now, you might think
that the playbook is going to run like this: with the dependency
structure we created in the preceding code, our initial playbook
statically imports the [platform] role. The [platform] role
then states that it depends upon the [linuxtype] role, and the
dependency is declared twice with a different value in a variable called
[type] each time. The [linuxtype] role then states that it
depends upon both the [network] and [version] roles, which
are allowed to run more than once and print the value of [type].
Hence, you could be forgiven for thinking that we\'ll see the
[network] and [version] roles called twice, printing
[centos] once and [ubuntu] the second time (as this is how
we originally specified the dependencies in the [platform] role).
However, when we run it, we actually see this:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml

PLAY [Role variables and meta playbook] ****************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [frt01.example.com]

TASK [version : Print type variable] *******************************************
ok: [frt01.example.com] => {
    "type": "ubuntu"
}

TASK [network : Print type variable] *******************************************
ok: [frt01.example.com] => {
    "type": "ubuntu"
}

TASK [version : Print type variable] *******************************************
ok: [frt01.example.com] => {
    "type": "ubuntu"
}

TASK [network : Print type variable] *******************************************
ok: [frt01.example.com] => {
    "type": "ubuntu"
}

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
frt01.example.com : ok=5 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
```

If we are to continue using statically
imported roles, then we should not use role variables when we declare
the dependencies. Instead, we should pass over [type] as a role
parameter. This is a small but crucial difference---role parameters
remain scoped at the role level even when the Ansible parser is run,
hence we can declare our dependency twice without the variable getting
overwritten. To do this, change the contents of
the [roles/platform/meta/main.yml] file to the following:

```
---
dependencies:
- role: linuxtype
  type: centos
- role: linuxtype
  type: ubuntu
```

Do you notice the subtle change? The [vars:] keyword has gone, and
the declaration of [type] is now at a lower indentation level,
meaning it is a role parameter. Now, when we run the playbook, we get
the results that we had hoped for:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml

PLAY [Role variables and meta playbook] ****************************************

```

This is quite an advanced example of Ansible role dependencies but it
has been provided to you to demonstrate the importance of knowing a
little about variable precedence (that is, where the variable is scoped)
and how the parser works. If you write simple, sequentially parsed
tasks, then you may never need to know this, but I recommend that you
make extensive use of the debug statement and test your playbook design
to make sure that you don\'t fall foul of this during your playbook
development. 

Having look in great detail at a number of aspects of roles, let\'s take
a look in the following section at a centralized store for publicly
available Ansible roles --- Ansible Galaxy.



Ansible Galaxy
--------------

No section on Ansible roles would be complete without a mention of
Ansible Galaxy. Ansible Galaxy is a community-driven collection of
Ansible roles, hosted by Ansible at <https://galaxy.ansible.com/>. It
contains a great many community-contributed Ansible roles, and if you
can conceive of an automation task, there is a good chance someone has
already written a role to do exactly what you want it to do. It is well
worth exploring and can get your automation project off the ground
quickly as you can start work with a set of ready-made roles.

In addition to the web site, the [ansible-galaxy] client is
included in Ansible, and this provides a quick and convenient way for
you to download and deploy roles into your playbook structure. Let\'s
say that you want to update the **message of the day** (**MOTD**) on
your target hosts---this is surely something that somebody has already
figured out. A quick search on the Ansible Galaxy website returns (at
the time of writing) 106 roles for setting the MOTD. If we want to use
one of these, we could download it into our roles directory using the
following command:

```
ansible-galaxy role install -p roles/ arillso.motd
```

That\'s all you need to do---once the download is complete, you can
import or include the role in your playbook just as you would for the
manually created roles we have discussed in this lab. Note that if
you don\'t specify [-p roles/], [ansible-galaxy] installs
the roles into [\~/.ansible/roles], the central roles directory
for your user account. This might be what you want, of course, but if
you want the role downloaded directly into your playbook directory
structure, you would add this parameter.

Another neat trick is to use [ansible-galaxy] to create an empty
role directory structure for you to create your own roles in---this
saves all of the manual directory and file creation we have been
undertaking in this lab, as in this example:

```
ansible-galaxy role init --init-path roles/ testrole

- Role testrole was created successfully
tree roles/testrole/

```


Using conditions in your code
=============================

In most of our examples so far, we have created simple sets of tasks
that always run. However, as you generate tasks (whether in roles or
playbooks) that you want to apply to a wider array of hosts, sooner or
later, you will want to perform some kind of conditional action. This
might be to only perform a task in response to the results of a previous
task. Or it might be to only perform a task in response to a specific
fact gathered from an Ansible system. In this section, we will provide
some practical examples of conditional logic to apply to your Ansible
tasks to demonstrate how to use this feature.

As ever, we\'ll need an inventory to get started, and we\'ll reuse the
inventory we have used throughout this lab:

```
[frontends]
frt01.example.com https_port=8443
frt02.example.com http_proxy=proxy.example.com

[frontends:vars]
ntp_server=ntp.frt.example.com
proxy=proxy.frt.example.com

[apps]
app01.example.com
app02.example.com

[webapp:children]
frontends
apps

[webapp:vars]
proxy_server=proxy.webapp.example.com
health_check_retry=3
health_check_interal=60
```


Let\'s define the task that will perform our update but add a
[when] clause containing a Jinja 2 expressions to it in a simple
example playbook:

```
---
- name: Play to patch only CentOS systems
  hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: Patch Ubuntu systems
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: latest
    when: ansible_facts['distribution'] == "Ubuntu"
```

Now, when we run this task, if your test system(s) are Ubuntu-based (and
mine are), you should see output similar to the following:

```

cd ~/Desktop/gitlab-ci-ansible-course/Lab_16
ansible-playbook -i hosts condition.yml

PLAY [Play to patch only CentOS systems] ***************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [frt02.example.com]
ok: [app01.example.com]
ok: [frt01.example.com]
ok: [app02.example.com]

TASK [Patch Ubuntu systems] ****************************************************
ok: [app01.example.com]
changed: [frt01.example.com]
ok: [app02.example.com]
ok: [frt02.example.com]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
app01.example.com : ok=2 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
app02.example.com : ok=2 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
frt01.example.com : ok=2 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
frt02.example.com : ok=2 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
```

The preceding output shows that all of our systems were Ubuntu-based,
but that only [frt01.example.com] needed the patch applying. Now
we can make our logic more precise---perhaps it is only our legacy
systems that need the patch applying. In
this case, we can expand the logic in our playbook to check both the
distribution and major version, as follows:

```
---
- name: Play to patch only Ubuntu systems
  hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: Patch Ubuntu systems
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: latest
    when: (ansible_facts['distribution'] == "Ubuntu" and ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] == "20")
```

Now, if we run our modified playbook, depending on the systems you have
in your inventory, you might see output similar to the following. In
this case, my [app01.example.com] server was based on CentOS 6 so
had the patch applied. All other systems were skipped because they did
not match my logical expression:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts condition2.yml

PLAY [Play to patch only Ubuntu systems] ***************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [frt01.example.com]
ok: [app02.example.com]
ok: [app01.example.com]
ok: [frt02.example.com]

TASK [Patch Ubuntu systems] ****************************************************
changed: [app01.example.com]
skipping: [frt01.example.com]
skipping: [frt02.example.com]
skipping: [app02.example.com]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
app01.example.com   : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   
app02.example.com   : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   
frt01.example.com   : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   
frt02.example.com   : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   
```


Consider the following playbook code. It contains two tasks, the first
of which is to obtain the listing of the current directory and capture
the output of the [shell] module in a variable called
[shellresult]. When then print a simple [debug] message, but
only on the condition that the [hosts] string is in the output of
the [shell] command:

```
---
- name: Play to patch only CentOS systems
  hosts: localhost
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Gather directory listing from local system
      shell: "ls -l"
      register: shellresult

    - name: Alert if we find a hosts file
      debug:
        msg: "Found hosts file!"
      when: '"hosts" in shellresult.stdout'
```

Now, when we run this in the current directory, which if you are working
from the GitHub repository that accompanies this course will contain a
file named [hosts], then you should see output similar to the
following:

```
ansible-playbook condition3.yml

[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note that
the implicit localhost does not match 'all'

PLAY [Play to patch only CentOS systems] ***************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Gather directory listing from local system] ******************************
changed: [localhost]

TASK [Alert if we find a hosts file] *******************************************
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": "Found hosts file!"
}

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
localhost : ok=3 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
```

Yet, if the file doesn\'t exist, then you\'ll see that the [debug] message gets skipped:

```
ansible-playbook condition3.yml


[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note that
the implicit localhost does not match 'all'

PLAY [Play to patch only CentOS systems] ***************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Gather directory listing from local system] ******************************
changed: [localhost]

TASK [Alert if we find a hosts file] *******************************************
skipping: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
localhost : ok=2 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=1 rescued=0 ignored=0
```

You can also create complex conditions for IT operational tasks in
production; however, remember that, in Ansible, variables are not cast
to any particular type by default, and hence even though the contents of
a variable (or fact) might look like a number, Ansible will by default
treat it as a string. If you need to perform an integer comparison
instead, you must first cast the variable to an integer type. For
example, here is a fragment of a playbook that will run a task only on
Fedora 25 and newer:

```
tasks:
  - name: Only perform this task on Fedora 25 and later
    shell: echo "only on Fedora 25 and later"
    when: ansible_facts['distribution'] == "Fedora" and ansible_facts['distribution_major_version']|int >= 25
```

There are many different types of conditionals you can apply to your
Ansible tasks, and this section is just scratching the surface; however,
it should give you a sound basis on which to expand your knowledge of
applying conditions to your tasks in Ansible. Not only can you apply
conditional logic to Ansible tasks, but you can also run them in loops
over a set of data, and we shall explore this in the next section.


Repeating tasks with loops
==========================

Oftentimes, we will want to perform a single task, but use that single
task to iterate over a set of data. For example, you might not want to
create one user account but 10. Or you might want to install 15 packages
to a system. The possibilities are endless, but the point remains the
same---you would not want to write 10 individual Ansible tasks to create
10 user accounts. Fortunately, Ansible supports looping over datasets to
ensure that you can perform large scale operations using tightly defined
code. In this section, we will explore how to make practical use of
loops in your Ansible playbooks.

As ever, we must start with an inventory to work against, and we will
use our by-now familiar inventory, which we have consistently used
throughout this lab:

```
[frontends]
frt01.example.com https_port=8443
frt02.example.com http_proxy=proxy.example.com

[frontends:vars]
ntp_server=ntp.frt.example.com
proxy=proxy.frt.example.com

[apps]
app01.example.com
app02.example.com

[webapp:children]
frontends
apps

[webapp:vars]
proxy_server=proxy.webapp.example.com
health_check_retry=3
health_check_interal=60
```

Let\'s start with a really simple playbook to show you how to loop over
a set of data in a single task. Although this is quite a contrived
example, it is intended to be simple to show you the fundamentals of how
loops work in Ansible. We will define a single task that runs the
[command] module on a single host from the inventory and uses the
[command] module to [echo] the numbers 1 through 6 in turn
on the remote system (with some imagination, this could easily be
extended to adding user accounts or creating a sequence of files).

Consider the following code:

```
---
- name: Simple loop demo play
  hosts: frt01.example.com

  tasks:
    - name: Echo a value from the loop
      command: echo "{{ item }}"
      loop:
        - 1
        - 2
        - 3
        - 4
        - 5
        - 6
```

The [loop:] statement defines the start of the loop, and the items
in the loop are defined as a YAML list. Also, note the higher
indentation level, which tells the parser they are part of the loop.
When working with the loop data, we use a special variable called
[item], which contains the current value from the loop iteration
to be echoed. Hence, if we run this playbook, we should see output
similar to the following:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts loop1.yml


PLAY [Simple loop demo play] ***************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [frt01.example.com]

TASK [Echo a value from the loop] **********************************************
changed: [frt01.example.com] => (item=1)
changed: [frt01.example.com] => (item=2)
changed: [frt01.example.com] => (item=3)
changed: [frt01.example.com] => (item=4)
changed: [frt01.example.com] => (item=5)
changed: [frt01.example.com] => (item=6)

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
frt01.example.com : ok=2 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
```

You can combine the conditional logic we discussed in the preceding
section with loops, to make the loop operate on just a subset of its
data. For example, consider the following iteration of the playbook:

```
---
- name: Simple loop demo play
  hosts: frt01.example.com

  tasks:
    - name: Echo a value from the loop
      command: echo "{{ item }}"
      loop:
        - 1
        - 2
        - 3
        - 4
        - 5
        - 6
      when: item|int > 3
```

Now, when we run this, we see that the task is skipped until we reach
the integer value of 4 and higher in the loop contents:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts loop2.yml

PLAY [Simple loop demo play] ***************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [frt01.example.com]

TASK [Echo a value from the loop] **********************************************
skipping: [frt01.example.com] => (item=1)
skipping: [frt01.example.com] => (item=2)
skipping: [frt01.example.com] => (item=3)
changed: [frt01.example.com] => (item=4)
changed: [frt01.example.com] => (item=5)
changed: [frt01.example.com] => (item=6)

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
frt01.example.com : ok=2 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
```

You can, of course, combine this with the conditional logic based on
Ansible facts and other variables in the manner we discussed previously.
Just as we captured the results of a module\'s execution using the
[register] keyword before, we can do so with loops. The only
difference is that the results will now be stored in a dictionary, with
one dictionary entry for each iteration of the loop rather than just one
set of results. 

Hence, let\'s see what happens if we further enhance the playbook, as
follows:

```
---
- name: Simple loop demo play
  hosts: frt01.example.com

  tasks:
    - name: Echo a value from the loop
      command: echo "{{ item }}"
      loop:
        - 1
        - 2
        - 3
        - 4
        - 5
        - 6
      when: item|int > 3
      register: loopresult

    - name: Print the results from the loop
      debug:
        var: loopresult
```



Now, when we run the playbook, you will see pages out output containing
the dictionary with the contents of [loopresult]. The following
output is truncated in the interests of space but demonstrates the kind
of results you should expect from running this playbook:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts loop3.yml

PLAY [Simple loop demo play] ***************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [frt01.example.com]

TASK [Echo a value from the loop] **********************************************
skipping: [frt01.example.com] => (item=1)
skipping: [frt01.example.com] => (item=2)
skipping: [frt01.example.com] => (item=3)
changed: [frt01.example.com] => (item=4)
changed: [frt01.example.com] => (item=5)
changed: [frt01.example.com] => (item=6)

TASK [Print the results from the loop] *****************************************
ok: [frt01.example.com] => {
    "loopresult": {
        "changed": true,
        "msg": "All items completed",
        "results": [
            {
                "ansible_loop_var": "item",
                "changed": false,
                "item": 1,
                "skip_reason": "Conditional result was False",
                "skipped": true
            },
            {
                "ansible_loop_var": "item",
                "changed": false,
                "item": 2,
                "skip_reason": "Conditional result was False",
                "skipped": true
            },
```

As you can see, the results section of the output is a dictionary, and
we can clearly see that the first two items in the list were
[skipped] because the result of our [when] clause
([Conditional]) was [false].



First of all, we\'ll create a playbook in the usual manner, with a
single task to run in a loop. To generate our nested loop, we\'ll use
the [include\_tasks] directory to dynamically include a single
task from another YAML file that will also contain a loop. As we\'re
intending to use this playbook in a nested loop, we\'ll use the
[loop\_var] directive to change the name of the special loop
contents variable from [item] to [second\_item]:

```
---
- name: Play to demonstrate nested loops
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:
    - name: Outer loop
      include_tasks: loopsubtask.yml
      loop:
        - a
        - b
        - c
      loop_control:
        loop_var: second_item
```

Then, we\'ll create a second file called [loopsubtask.yml], which
contains the inner loop and is included in the preceding playbook. As
we\'re already changed the loop item variable name in the outer loop, we
don\'t need to change it again here. Note that the structure of this
file is very much like a tasks file in a role---it is not a complete
playbook, but rather simply a list of tasks:

```
---
- name: Inner loop
  debug:
    msg: "second item={{ second_item }} first item={{ item }}"
  loop:
    - 100
    - 200
    - 300
```

Now you should be able to run the playbook, and you will see Ansible
iterate over the outer loop first and then process the inner loop over
the data defined by the outer loop. As the loop variable names do not
clash, all works exactly as we would expect:

```
ansible-playbook loopmain.yml

```

Loops are simple to work with, and yet very powerful as they allow you
to easily use one task to iterate over a large set of data. In the next
section, we\'ll look at another construct of the Ansible language for
controlling playbook flow---blocks.


Grouping tasks using blocks
===========================

Blocks in Ansible allow you to logically group a set of tasks together,
primarily for one of two purposes. One might be to apply conditional
logic to an entire set of tasks; in this example, you could apply an
identical when clause to each of the tasks, but this is cumbersome and
inefficient---far better to place all of the tasks in a block and apply
the conditional logic to the block itself. In this way, the logic only
needs to be declared once. Blocks are also valuable when it comes to
error handling and especially when it comes to recovering from an error
condition. We shall explore both of these through simple practical
examples in this lab to get you up to speed with blocks in Ansible.

As ever, let\'s ensure we have an inventory to work from:

```
[frontends]
frt01.example.com https_port=8443
frt02.example.com http_proxy=proxy.example.com

[frontends:vars]
ntp_server=ntp.frt.example.com
proxy=proxy.frt.example.com

[apps]
app01.example.com
app02.example.com

[webapp:children]
frontends
apps

[webapp:vars]
proxy_server=proxy.webapp.example.com
health_check_retry=3
health_check_interal=60
```

Now, let\'s dive straight in and look at an example of how you would use
blocks to apply conditional logic to a set of tasks. At a high level,
suppose we want to perform the following actions on all of our Fedora
Linux hosts:

-   Install the package for the Apache web server.
-   Install a templated configuration.
-   Start the appropriate service.

We could achieve this with three individual tasks, all with a
[when] clause associated with them, but blocks provide us with a
better way. The following example playbook shows the three tasks
discussed contained in a block (notice the additional level of
indentation required to denote their presence in the block):

```
---
- name: Conditional block play
  hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: Install and configure Apache
    block:
      - name: Install the Apache package
        dnf:
          name: apache2
          state: installed
      - name: Install the templated configuration to a dummy location
        template:
          src: templates/src.j2
          dest: /tmp/my.conf
      - name: Start the apache2 service
        service:
          name: apache2
          state: started
          enabled: True
    when: ansible_facts['distribution'] == 'Fedora'
```

When you run this playbook, you should find that the Apache-related
tasks are only run on any Fedora hosts you might have in your inventory;
you should see that either all three tasks are run or are
skipped---depending on the makeup and contents of your inventory, it
might look something like this:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts blocks.yml

PLAY [Conditional block play] **************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [app02.example.com]
ok: [frt01.example.com]
ok: [app01.example.com]
ok: [frt02.example.com]

TASK [Install the Apache package] **********************************************
changed: [frt01.example.com]
changed: [frt02.example.com]
skipping: [app01.example.com]
skipping: [app02.example.com]

TASK [Install the templated configuration to a dummy location] *****************
changed: [frt01.example.com]
changed: [frt02.example.com]
skipping: [app01.example.com]
skipping: [app02.example.com]

TASK [Start the apache2 service] *************************************************
changed: [frt01.example.com]
changed: [frt02.example.com]
skipping: [app01.example.com]
skipping: [app02.example.com]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
app01.example.com : ok=1 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=3 rescued=0 ignored=0
app02.example.com : ok=1 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=3 rescued=0 ignored=0
frt01.example.com : ok=4 changed=3 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=3 rescued=0 ignored=0
frt02.example.com : ok=4 changed=3 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=3 rescued=0 ignored=0
```

This is very simple to construct, but very powerful in terms of the
effect it has on your ability to control the flow over large sets of
tasks. 

This time, let\'s build a different example to demonstrate how blocks
can be utilized to help Ansible to handle error conditions gracefully.
So far, you should have experienced that if your playbooks encounter any
errors, they are likely to stop executing at the point of failure. This
is in some situations far from ideal, and you might want to perform some
kind of recovery actions in this event rather than simply halting the
playbook.

Let\'s create a new playbook, this time with the following contents:

```
---
- name: Play to demonstrate block error handling
  hosts: frontends

  tasks:
    - name: block to handle errors
      block:
        - name: Perform a successful task
          debug:
            msg: 'Normally executing....'
        - name: Deliberately create an error
          command: /bin/whatever
        - name: This task should not run if the previous one results in an error
          debug:
            msg: 'Never print this message if the above command fails!!!!'
      rescue:
        - name: Catch the error (and perform recovery actions)
          debug:
            msg: 'Caught the error'
        - name: Deliberately create another error
          command: /bin/whatever
        - name: This task should not run if the previous one results in an error
          debug:
            msg: 'Do not print this message if the above command fails!!!!'
      always:
        - name: This task always runs!
          debug:
            msg: "Tasks in this part of the play will be ALWAYS executed!!!!"
```

Notice that in the preceding play, we now have additional sections to
[block] --- as well as the tasks in [block] itself, we have
two new parts labeled [rescue] and [always]. The flow of
execution is as follows:


With this flow of execution in mind, you should see output similar to
the following when you execute this playbook, noting that we have
deliberately created two error conditions to demonstrate the flow:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts blocks-error.yml

PLAY [Play to demonstrate block error handling] ********************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [frt02.example.com]
ok: [frt01.example.com]

TASK [Perform a successful task] ***********************************************
ok: [frt01.example.com] => {
    "msg": "Normally executing...."
}
ok: [frt02.example.com] => {
    "msg": "Normally executing...."
}

TASK [Deliberately create an error] ********************************************
fatal: [frt01.example.com]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "cmd": "/bin/whatever", "msg": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory", "rc": 2}
fatal: [frt02.example.com]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "cmd": "/bin/whatever", "msg": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory", "rc": 2}

TASK [Catch the error (and perform recovery actions)] **************************
ok: [frt01.example.com] => {
    "msg": "Caught the error"
}
ok: [frt02.example.com] => {
    "msg": "Caught the error"
}

TASK [Deliberately create another error] ***************************************
fatal: [frt01.example.com]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "cmd": "/bin/whatever", "msg": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory", "rc": 2}
fatal: [frt02.example.com]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "cmd": "/bin/whatever", "msg": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory", "rc": 2}

TASK [This task always runs!] **************************************************
ok: [frt01.example.com] => {
    "msg": "Tasks in this part of the play will be ALWAYS executed!!!!"
}
ok: [frt02.example.com] => {
    "msg": "Tasks in this part of the play will be ALWAYS executed!!!!"
}

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
frt01.example.com : ok=4 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=1 skipped=0 rescued=1 ignored=0
frt02.example.com : ok=4 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=1 skipped=0 rescued=1 ignored=0
```




Configuring play execution via strategies
=========================================


The most useful strategy when you are starting work with Ansible,
however, is going to be the [debug] strategy, and this enables
Ansible to drop you straight into its integrated debug environment if an
error should occur in the playbook. Let\'s demonstrate this by creating
a playbook that has a deliberate error in it. Note the [strategy:
debug] and [debugger: on\_failed] statements in the play
definition:

```
---
- name: Play to demonstrate the debug strategy
  hosts: frt01.example.com
  strategy: debug
  debugger: on_failed
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    username: daniel

  tasks:
    - name: Generate an error by referencing an undefined variable
      ping: data={{ mobile }}
```

Now if you execute this playbook, you should see that it starts to run,
but then drops you into the integrated debugger when it encounters the
deliberate error it contains. The start of the output should be similar
to the following:


```
ansible-playbook -i hosts debug.yml

PLAY [Play to demonstrate the debug strategy] **********************************

TASK [Generate an error by referencing an undefined variable] ******************
fatal: [frt01.example.com]: FAILED! => {"msg": "The task includes an option with an undefined variable. The error was: 'mobile' is undefined\n\nThe error appears to be in '/root/Desktop/gitlab-ci-ansible-course/Lab_16/debug.yml': line 11, column 7, but may\nbe elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.\n\nThe offending line appears to be:\n\n tasks:\n - name: Generate an error by referencing an undefined variable\n ^ here\n"}
[frt01.example.com] TASK: Generate an error by referencing an undefined variable (debug)>


[frt02.prod.com] TASK: make an error with refering incorrect variable (debug)> p task_vars
{'ansible_check_mode': False,
 'ansible_current_hosts': [u'frt02.prod.com'],
 'ansible_diff_mode': False,
 'ansible_facts': {},
 'ansible_failed_hosts': [],
 'ansible_forks': 5,
...
[frt02.prod.com] TASK: make an error with refering incorrect variable (debug)> quit
User interrupted execution

```


To take you through a very simple, practical debugging example, however,
enter the [p task] command at the prompt---this will cause the
Ansible debugger to print the name of the failing task; this is very
useful if you are in the midst of a large playbook:

```
[frt01.example.com] TASK: Generate an error by referencing an undefined variable (debug)> p task
TASK: Generate an error by referencing an undefined variable
```

Now we know where the play failed, so let\'s dig a little deeper by
issuing the [p task.args] command, which will show us the
arguments that were passed to the module in the task:

```
[frt01.example.com] TASK: Generate an error by referencing an undefined variable (debug)> p task.args
{u'data': u'{{ mobile }}'}
```

So, we can see that our module was passed the argument called
[data], with the argument value being a variable (denoted by the
pairs of curly braces) called [mobile]. Hence, it might be logical
to have a look at the variables available to the task, to see whether
this variable exists, and if so whether the value is sensible (use the
[p task\_vars] command to do this):

```
[frt01.example.com] TASK: Generate an error by referencing an undefined variable (debug)> p task_vars
{'ansible_check_mode': False,
 'ansible_current_hosts': [u'frt01.example.com'],
 'ansible_dependent_role_names': [],
 'ansible_diff_mode': False,
 'ansible_facts': {},
 'ansible_failed_hosts': [],
 'ansible_forks': 5,
```

The preceding output is truncated, and you will find a great many
variables associated with the task---this is because any gathered facts,
and internal Ansible variables, are all available to the task. However,
if you scroll through the list, you will be able to confirm that there
is no variable called [mobile].

Hence, this should be enough information to fix your playbook. Enter
[q] to quit the debugger:

```
[frt01.example.com] TASK: Generate an error by referencing an undefined variable (debug)> q
User interrupted execution
```

The Ansible debugger is an incredibly powerful tool and you should learn
to make effective use of it, especially as your playbook complexity
grows. This concludes our practical look at the various aspects of
playbook design---in the next section, we\'ll take a look at the ways in
which you can integrate Git source code management into your playbooks.


Using ansible-pull
==================
. 



Let\'s use a simple playbook from GitHub that sets the message of the
day based on variable content. To do this, we will run the following
command (which we\'ll break down in a minute):

```
ansible-pull -d /var/ansible-set-motd -i ${HOSTNAME}, -U https://github.com/fenago/ansible-set-motd.git site.yml -e "ag_motd_content='MOTD generated by ansible-pull'" >> /tmp/ansible-pull.log 2>&1
```


When you run this command, you should see some output similar to the
following (note that log redirection has been removed to make it easier
to see the output):

```
ansible-pull -d /var/ansible-set-motd -i ${HOSTNAME}, -U https://github.com/fenago/ansible-set-motd.git site.yml -e "ag_motd_content='MOTD generated by ansible-pull'"

```

This command can be a very powerful part of your overall Ansible
solution, especially as it means you don\'t have to worry too greatly
about running all of your playbooks centrally, or ensuring that they are
all up to date every time you run them. The ability to schedule this in
[cron] is especially powerful in a large infrastructure where,
ideally, automation means things should take care of themselves.

This concludes our practical look at playbooks and how to author your
own code---with a little research into Ansible modules, you should now
have enough to write your own robust playbooks with ease.


Summary
=======


In this lab, you learned about the playbook framework and how to
start building your own playbooks. You then learned how to organize your
code into roles and design your code to effectively and efficiently
support reuse. We then explored some of the more advanced playbook
writing topics such as working with conditional logic, blocks, and
loops. Finally, we looked at playbook execution strategies, especially
with a view to being able to debug your playbooks effectively, and we
wrapped up with a look at how you can run Ansible playbooks on a local
machine directly from GitHub.

In the next lab, we will learn how to consume and create our very
own modules, providing you with the skills you need to expand the
capabilities of Ansible to suit your own bespoke environments, and to
contribute back to the community.
